#'
#' @description
#' \pkg{metan} provides functions for performing the most used analyses in the
#' evaluation of multi-environment trials, including, but not limited to:
#' * ANOVA-based stability statistics;
#' * AMMI-based stability indexes;
#' * BLUP-based stability indexes;
#' * Cross-validation procedures for AMMI-family and BLUP models;
#' * GGE biplot analysis;
#' * Estimation using AMMI considering different numbers of interaction
#' principal component axes;
#' * Graphics tools for generating biplots;
#' * Nonparametric stability statistics;
#' * Variance components and genetic parameters in mixed-effect models;
#' * Within-environment analysis of variance;
